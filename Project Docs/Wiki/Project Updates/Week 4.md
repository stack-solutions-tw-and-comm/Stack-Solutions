## Topic: Initial feature setup

## At‑a‑glance:
| Overall status | % complete (this week) | Top risk (one line) |
|---|---|---|
|On track / At risk 15%| Implementation of chatbot into website (low risk)| No particular questions|

## What we shipped/completed this week:
• interactive chat bot
• preliminary risk profile quiz without html integration

## Evidence & Links (paste URLs):
• Video of chatbot will be submitted alongside this word doc
• Video of risk assessment quiz will also be submitted

## Decisions made (owner, date):
• Aaden – Decided to use online chatbot service as opposed to coding one from scratch
(October 1st, 2025)
• Pranav – Not implementing the risk assessment quiz to the website until the website is
fully completed (September 29th, 2025)

## Challenges & risks (severity, mitigation):
• AI chatbot lack of databases and information (low severity)
Mitigation – Research and integrate open-source or public APIs
• Limited team experience with programming websites (medium severity)
Mitigation – Taking online website coding courses, watching videos, learning as we go

## Plan for next week (task → owner → due date):
• Fully integrate the chatbot into the website – (Aaden, October 11th)
• Complete website front page (Tony, October 12th)
• Implement risk assessment quiz (Mahad, October 11th)
